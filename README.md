# Minecraft: Redone
A mod that aims to fix the flaws of modern and beta minecraft by giving more uses to otherwise useless items and adding more things to do in the game.

# how to install?
## I want to do it myself: 
1) get a launcher - I suggest using multimc, polymc or prismmc.
2) create an instance under the version of beta 1.7.3
3) download minecraft.jar in releases
4) edit instance and either replace or add minecraft.jar 

## I am lazy:
1) get multimc, polymc or prismmc
2) download the zip file in the latest releases
3) import it by clicking `add instance` and then `import zip`
4) launch game
