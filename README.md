# New-Minecraft
A mod that aims to fix the flaws of modern and beta minecraft by giving more uses to otherwise useless items and adding more things to do in the game.

# how to install?
1) get a launcher - I suggest using multimc, polymc or prismmc.
2) create an instance under the version of beta 1.7.3
3) edit instance and add minecraft.zip in releases to the jar
